Auth is a user management and authentication server written in Go that powers
[Supabase](https://supabase.com)'s features such as:

<Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" /> Issuing JWTs <br/>
<Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" /> Row Level Security with PostgREST<br/>
<Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" /> User management<br/>
<Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" /> Sign in with email, password, magic link, phone number<br/>
<Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" /> Sign in with external providers (Google, Apple, Facebook, Discord, ...)<br/>

It is originally based on the excellent
[GoTrue codebase by Netlify](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue), however both have diverged significantly in features and capabilities.
