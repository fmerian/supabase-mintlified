title: "Running in production"
---

Running an authentication server in production is not an easy feat. We
recommend using [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/auth) which gets regular
security updates.

Otherwise, please make sure you setup a process to promptly update to the
latest version. You can do that by following this repository, specifically the
[Releases](https://github.com/supabase/auth/releases) and [Security
Advisories](https://github.com/supabase/auth/security/advisories) sections.

## Backward compatibility

Auth uses the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) scheme. Here are some
further clarifications on backward compatibility guarantees:

**Go API compatibility**

Auth is not meant to be used as a Go library. There are no guarantees on
backward API compatibility when used this way regardless which version number
changes.

**Patch**

Changes to the patch version guarantees backward compatibility with:

- Database objects (tables, columns, indexes, functions).
- REST API
- JWT structure
- Configuration

Guaranteed examples:

- A column won't change its type.
- A table won't change its primary key.
- An index will not be removed.
- A uniqueness constraint will not be removed.
- A REST API will not be removed.
- Parameters to REST APIs will work equivalently as before (or better, if a bug
  has been fixed).
- Configuration will not change.

Not guaranteed examples:

- A table may add new columns.
- Columns in a table may be reordered.
- Non-unique constraints may be removed (database level checks, null, default
  values).
- JWT may add new properties.

**Minor**

Changes to minor version guarantees backward compatibility with:

- REST API
- JWT structure
- Configuration

Exceptions to these guarantees will be made only when serious security issues
are found that can't be remedied in any other way.

Guaranteed examples:

- Existing APIs may be deprecated but continue working for the next few minor
  version releases.
- Configuration changes may become deprecated but continue working for the next
  few minor version releases.
- Already issued JWTs will be accepted, but new JWTs may be with a different
  structure (but usually similar).

Not guaranteed examples:

- Removal of JWT fields after a deprecation notice.
- Removal of certain APIs after a deprecation notice.
- Removal of sign-in with external providers, after a deprecation notice.
- Deletion, truncation, significant schema changes to tables, indexes, views,
  functions.

We aim to provide a deprecation notice in execution logs for at least two major
version releases or two weeks if multiple releases go out. Compatibility will
be guaranteed while the notice is live.

**Major**

Changes to the major version do not guarantee any backward compatibility with
previous versions.

## Inherited features

Certain inherited features from the Netlify codebase are not supported by
Supabase and they may be removed without prior notice in the future. This is a
comprehensive list of those features:

1. Multi-tenancy via the `instances` table i.e. `GOTRUE_MULTI_INSTANCE_MODE`
   configuration parameter.
2. System user (zero UUID user).
3. Super admin via the `is_super_admin` column.
4. Group information in JWTs via `GOTRUE_JWT_ADMIN_GROUP_NAME` and other
   configuration fields.
5. Symmetrics JWTs. In the future it is very likely that Auth will begin
   issuing asymmetric JWTs (subject to configuration), so do not rely on the
   assumption that only HS256 signed JWTs will be issued long term.

Note that this is not an exhaustive list and it may change.

## Best practices when self-hosting

These are some best practices to follow when self-hosting to ensure backward
compatibility with Auth:

1. Do not modify the schema managed by Auth. You can see all of the
   migrations in the `migrations` directory.
2. Do not rely on schema and structure of data in the database. Always use
   Auth APIs and JWTs to infer information about users.
3. Always run Auth behind a TLS-capable proxy such as a load balancer, CDN,
   nginx or other similar software.
